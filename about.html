    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>My name's Jung Min (Judy) Lee and I'm a student in the Post-Bacc Computer Science Program at Oregon State University.
            I'm currently taking CS290: Web Development and plan to take CS340 in winter and later on CS325 in spring.</p><br>
        <p>I'm a non-traditional student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a background in psychology and healthcare.
            I previously worked in healthcare industry due to my passion for wanting to improve people's lives. However, after learning about the huge impact that
            technology made in patient's healthcare experiences and rediscovering my love for coding, I decided to go back to school for a Computer Science degree.
            I hope to utilize my new Computer Science skills to work on meaningful projects that can help people around the world! </p><br>

        <p>I'm currently looking for internship and co-op opportunities - please feel free to reach out!</p><br>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy cooking, crocheting, drawing, and playing video games.
            I'm currently obsessed with Final Fantasy XIV - here are some pics of my character and friends in the game.</p><br>
